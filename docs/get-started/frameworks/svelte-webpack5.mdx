Storybook for Svelte & Webpack is a [framework](../../contribute/framework.mdx) that makes it easy to develop and test UI components in isolation for applications using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) built with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

<If notRenderer="svelte">
  <Callout variant="info">
    Storybook for Svelte & Webpack is only supported in [Svelte](?renderer=svelte) projects.
  </Callout>

  {/* End non-supported renderers */}
</If>

<If renderer="svelte">
  ## Requirements

  * Svelte ≥ 4.0
  * Webpack ≥ 5.0
  * Storybook ≥ 8.0

  ## Getting started

  ### In a project without Storybook

  Follow the prompts after running this command in your Svelte project's root directory:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="init-command.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  [More on getting started with Storybook.](../install.mdx)

  ### In a project with Storybook

  This framework is designed to work with Storybook 7+. If you’re not already using v7, upgrade with this command:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="storybook-upgrade.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  #### Automatic migration

  When running the `upgrade` command above, you should get a prompt asking you to migrate to `@storybook/svelte-webpack5`, which should handle everything for you. In case that auto-migration does not work for your project, refer to the manual migration below.

  #### Manual migration

  First, install the framework:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="svelte-webpack5-install.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  Next, install and register your appropriate compiler addon, depending on whether you're using SWC (recommended) or Babel:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="storybook-addon-compiler-swc-auto-install.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  or

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="storybook-addon-compiler-babel-auto-install.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  More details can be found in the [Webpack builder docs](../../builders/webpack.mdx#compiler-support).

  Finally, update your `.storybook/main.js|ts` to change the framework property:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="svelte-webpack5-add-framework.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  ## API

  ### Options

  You can pass an options object for additional configuration if needed:

    {/* prettier-ignore-start */ }

  <CodeSnippets path="svelte-webpack-framework-options.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  The available options are:

  #### `builder`

  Type: `Record<string, any>`

  Configure options for the [framework's builder](../../api/main-config/main-config-framework.mdx#optionsbuilder). For this framework, available options can be found in the [Webpack builder docs](../../builders/webpack.mdx).

  ## Troubleshooting

  ### Svelte CSF addon compatibility

  In version 5 of the Svelte CSF [addon](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-svelte-csf), support for Webpack was removed to align with Svelte's ecosystem. If you're using this framework and you want to write stories using Svelte's native templating syntax with the Svelte CSF addon, we encourage you to downgrade to version 4 of the addon.
