Storybook for Angular is a [framework](../../contribute/framework.mdx) that makes it easy to develop and test UI components in isolation for [Angular](https://angular.io/) applications. It includes:

* 🧱 Uses Angular builders
* 🎛️ Compodoc integration
* 💫 and more!

<If notRenderer="angular">
  <Callout variant="info">
    Storybook for Angular is only supported in [Angular](?renderer=angular) projects.
  </Callout>

  {/* End non-supported renderers */}
</If>

<If renderer="angular">
  ## Requirements

  * Angular ≥ 15.0 \< 20.0
  * Webpack ≥ 5.0
  * Storybook ≥ 8.0

  ## Getting started

  ### In a project without Storybook

  Follow the prompts after running this command in your Angular project's root directory:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="init-command.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  [More on getting started with Storybook.](../install.mdx)

  ### In a project with Storybook

  This framework is designed to work with Storybook 7+. If you’re not already using v7, upgrade with this command:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="storybook-upgrade.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  #### Automatic migration

  When running the `upgrade` command above, you should get a prompt asking you to migrate to `@storybook/angular`, which should handle everything for you. In case that auto-migration does not work for your project, refer to the manual migration below.

  #### Manual migration

  First, install the framework:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="angular-install.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  Then, update your `.storybook/main.js|ts` to change the framework property:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="angular-add-framework.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  Finally, update your `angular.json` to include the Storybook builder:

  ```jsonc title="angular.json"
  {
    "projects": {
      "your-project": {
        "architect": {
          "storybook": {
            "builder": "@storybook/angular:start-storybook",
            "options": {
              // The path to the storybook config directory
              "configDir": ".storybook",
              // The build target of your project
              "browserTarget": "your-project:build",
              // The port you want to start Storybook on
              "port": 6006
              // More options available, documented here:
              // https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/code/frameworks/angular/src/builders/start-storybook/schema.json
            }
          },
          "build-storybook": {
            "builder": "@storybook/angular:build-storybook",
            "options": {
              "configDir": ".storybook",
              "browserTarget": "your-project:build",
              "outputDir": "dist/storybook/your-project"
              // More options available, documented here:
              // https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/code/frameworks/angular/src/builders/build-storybook/schema.json
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  ## Run Storybook

  To run Storybook for a particular project, please run the following:

  ```sh
  ng run <your-project>:storybook
  ```

  To build Storybook, run:

  ```sh
  ng run <your-project>:build-storybook
  ```

  You will find the output in the configured `outputDir` (default is `dist/storybook/<your-project>`).

  ## Setup Compodoc

  You can include JSDoc comments above components, directives, and other parts of your Angular code to include documentation for those elements. Compodoc uses these comments to [generate documentation](../../writing-docs/autodocs.mdx) for your application. In Storybook, it is useful to add explanatory comments above `@Inputs` and `@Outputs`, since these are the main elements that Storybook displays in its user interface. The `@Inputs` and `@Outputs` are elements you can interact with in Storybook, such as [controls](../../essentials/controls.mdx).

  ### Automatic setup

  When installing Storybook via `npx storybook@latest init`, you can set up Compodoc automatically.

  ### Manual setup

  If you have already installed Storybook, you can set up Compodoc manually.

  Install the following dependencies:

  ```sh
  npm install --save-dev @compodoc/compodoc
  ```

  Add the following option to your Storybook Builder:

  ```jsonc title="angular.json"
  {
    "projects": {
      "your-project": {
        "architect": {
          "storybook": {
            "builder": "@storybook/angular:start-storybook",
            "options": {
              // 👇 Add these
              "compodoc": true,
              "compodocArgs": [
                "-e",
                "json",
                "-d",
                // Where to store the generated documentation. It's usually the root of your Angular project. It's not necessarily the root of your Angular Workspace!
                "."
              ],
            }
          },
          "build-storybook": {
            "builder": "@storybook/angular:build-storybook",
            "options": {
              // 👇 Add these
              "compodoc": true,
              "compodocArgs": [
                "-e",
                "json",
                "-d",
                "."
              ],
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Go to your `.storybook/preview.ts` and add the following:

  ```ts title=".storybook/preview.ts"
  import type { Preview } from '@storybook/angular';

  // 👇 Add these
  import { setCompodocJson } from '@storybook/addon-docs/angular';
  import docJson from '../documentation.json';
  setCompodocJson(docJson);

  const preview: Preview = {};
  export default preview;
  ```

  ## `applicationConfig` decorator

  If your component relies on application-wide providers, like the ones defined by [`BrowserAnimationsModule`](https://angular.dev/api/platform-browser/animations/BrowserAnimationsModule) or any other modules that use the forRoot pattern to provide a [`ModuleWithProviders`](https://angular.dev/api/core/ModuleWithProviders), you can apply the `applicationConfig` [decorator](../../writing-stories/decorators.mdx) to all stories for that component. This will provide them with the [bootstrapApplication function](https://angular.io/guide/standalone-components#configuring-dependency-injection), used to bootstrap the component in Storybook.

  ```ts title="ChipsModule.stories.ts"
  import { Meta, applicationConfig, StoryObj } from '@storybook/angular';

  import { BrowserAnimationsModule, provideAnimations } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';
  import { importProvidersFrom } from '@angular/core';

  import { ChipsModule } from './angular-src/chips.module';

  const meta: Meta<ChipsModule> = {
    component: ChipsModule,
    decorators: [
      // Apply application config to all stories
      applicationConfig({
        // List of providers and environment providers that should be available to the root component and all its children.
        providers: [
          ...
          // Import application-wide providers from a module
          importProvidersFrom(BrowserAnimationsModule)
          // Or use provide-style functions if available instead, e.g.
          provideAnimations()
        ],
      }),
    ],
  };

  export default meta;
  type Story = StoryObj<ChipsModule>;

  export const WithCustomApplicationProvider: Story = {
    render: () => ({
      // Apply application config to a specific story
      applicationConfig: {
        // The providers will be merged with the ones defined in the applicationConfig decorator's providers array of the global meta object
        providers: [...],
      }
    })
  }
  ```

  ## `moduleMetadata` decorator

  If your component has dependencies on other Angular directives and modules, these can be supplied using the `moduleMetadata` [decorator](../../writing-stories/decorators.mdx) either for all stories of a component or for individual stories.

  ```ts title="YourComponent.stories.ts"
  import { Meta, moduleMetadata, StoryObj } from '@storybook/angular';

  import { YourComponent } from './your.component';

  const meta: Meta<YourComponent> = {
    component: YourComponent,
    decorators: [
      // Apply metadata to all stories
      moduleMetadata({
        // import necessary ngModules or standalone components
        imports: [...],
        // declare components that are used in the template
        declarations: [...],
        // List of providers that should be available to the root component and all its children.
        providers: [...],
      }),
    ],
  };
  export default meta;
  type Story = StoryObj<YourComponent>;

  export const Base: Story = {};

  export const WithCustomProvider: Story = {
    decorators: [
      // Apply metadata to a specific story
      moduleMetadata({
        imports: [...],
        declarations: [...],
        providers: [...],
      }),
    ],
  };
  ```

  ## FAQ

  ### How do I migrate to an Angular Storybook builder?

  The Storybook [Angular builder](https://angular.io/guide/glossary#builder) is a way to run Storybook in an Angular workspace. It is a drop-in replacement for running `storybook dev` and `storybook build` directly.

  You can run `npx storybook@next automigrate` to try letting Storybook detect and automatically fix your configuration. Otherwise, you can follow the next steps to adjust your configuration manually.

  #### Do you have only one Angular project in your workspace?

  First, go to your `angular.json` and add `storybook` and `build-storybook` entries in your project's `architect` section, as shown [above](#manual-setup).

  Second, adjust your `package.json` script section. Usually, it will look like this:

  ```jsonc title="package.json"
  {
    "scripts": {
      "storybook": "start-storybook -p 6006", // or `storybook dev -p 6006`
      "build-storybook": "build-storybook" // or `storybook build`
    }
  }
  ```

  Now, you can run Storybook with `ng run <your-project>:storybook` and build it with `ng run <your-project>:build-storybook`. Adjust the scripts in your `package.json` accordingly.

  ```json title="package.json"
  {
    "scripts": {
      "storybook": "ng run <project-name>:storybook",
      "build-storybook": "ng run <project-name>:build-storybook"
    }
  }
  ```

   Also, `compodoc` is now built into `@storybook/angular`; you don't have to call it explicitly. If we're running `compodoc` in your `package.json` scripts like this:

  ```json title="package.json"
  {
    "scripts": {
      "docs:json": "compodoc -p tsconfig.json -e json -d ./documentation",
      "storybook": "npm run docs:json && start-storybook -p 6006",
      "build-storybook": "npm run docs:json && build-storybook"
    }
  }
  ```

  Change it to:

  ```json title="package.json"
  {
    "scripts": {
      "storybook": "ng run <project-name>:storybook",
      "build-storybook": "ng run <project-name>:build-storybook"
    }
  }
  ```

  #### I have multiple projects in my Angular workspace

  In this case, you have to adjust your `angular.json` and `package.json` as described above for each project you want to use Storybook. Please note that each project should have a dedicated `.storybook` folder placed at the project's root.

  You can run `npx storybook@latest init` sequentially for each project to set up Storybook for each of them to automatically create the `.storybook` folder and create the necessary configuration in your `angular.json`.

  You can then combine multiple Storybooks with [Storybook composition](../../sharing/storybook-composition.mdx).

  ### How do I configure Angular's builder for Storybook?

  These are common options you may need for the Angular builder:

  ### Options

  You can pass an options object for additional configuration if needed:

  ```js title=".storybook/main.ts"
  import type { StorybookConfig } from '@storybook/angular';

  const config: StorybookConfig = {
    framework: {
      name: '@storybook/angular',
      options: {
        // ...
      },
    },
  };
  ```

  The available options are:

  #### `builder`
